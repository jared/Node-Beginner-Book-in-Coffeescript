An attempt to learn Coffeescript by writing the Node Beginner Book exercises in .coffee format.

The generated .js files have been added to .gitignore as they'll want to be generated before running.  Ideally each commit represents a stage in the development of the Node server application, so that walking through prior commits will illustrate the state of the coffeescript at each progress point.
